# 🚨 SURAKSHA SETU - COMMUNITY ALERT ROUTING SYSTEM
## Complete Implementation Guide

---

## 📋 OVERVIEW

The Community Alert Routing System provides:

1. **Automatic Alert Detection** - Detects help, emergency, alert, and warning posts in community
2. **AI-Generated Messages** - Creates brief 2-sentence context messages using Sarvam AI
3. **Smart Geographic Routing** - Finds nearby users and sends Telegram alerts
4. **SMS for Major Events Only** - Minimizes SMS usage to critical events only
5. **Admin Broadcast System** - Admins can send alerts to all users, by pincode, or specific users

---

## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### Step 1: User Posts in Community

```
POST /api/community/posts
{
    "content": "🚑 HELP! Medical emergency at Central Park. Someone needs an ambulance!",
    "type": "emergency",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "lat": 28.6139,
    "lon": 77.2090,
    "location": "Central Park, Delhi",
    "pincode": "110001"
}
```

### Step 2: Alert Detection

The system automatically detects alert keywords:
- **CRITICAL**: emergency, critical, disaster, attack, earthquake, trapped
- **HIGH**: help, urgent, alert, fire, flood, injury, medical, danger
- **MEDIUM**: warning

### Step 3: Nearby Users Discovery

System finds all active users with:
- ✅ Telegram chat ID linked
- ✅ Location information available  
- ✅ Within 5km radius (configurable)

### Step 4: AI Context Generation

Sarvam AI generates brief message:
```
"🚑 Medical emergency at Central Park - unconscious person. 
If you're nearby and can help safely, please respond immediately."
```

### Step 5: Telegram Notification

All nearby users receive:
```
🚨 EMERGENCY

🚑 Medical emergency at Central Park - unconscious person. 
If you're nearby and can help safely, please respond immediately.

📍 Location: Central Park, Delhi
👤 By: John Doe
⏰ Just Now

💬 Open app for details
```

### Step 6: SMS Sent (Major Events Only)

**SMS ONLY sent for these alert types:**
- 🌍 earthquake
- 🌊 flood
- 💥 disaster
- ⚔️ attack
- 🆘 emergency

**NOT sent for:** help, urgent, alert, warning, fire, injury, medical

Everyone take shelter under tables immediately!"
```

**System Response:**
1. ✅ Detects keyword: "EARTHQUAKE" (CRITICAL)

  must evacuate to Assembly Point A immediately"

---

## 📊 MONITORING & LOGS

### Check Backend Logs

Look for alert routing entries:

```
✅ Alert detected: help_request in post abc123
📍 Found 12 users within 5km
📱 Sent Telegram alerts: 12 succeeded, 0 failed
📞 Sent SMS to 0 users
✅ Alert routed: Telegram=12, SMS=0, Users=12
```

### Track Delivery

Each alert response includes:
- `alert_routing.telegram_sent` - Successful Telegram sends
- `alert_routing.telegram_failed` - Failed Telegram sends
- `alert_routing.sms_sent` - Successful SMS sends
- `alert_routing.nearby_users` - Total users found

---

## 🔐 SECURITY & PRIVACY

### User Privacy
- ✅ Geographic data only used for 5km radius calculation
- ✅ No location data shared between users
- ✅ Telegram chat ID not used for any other purpose
- ✅ SMS only to users with registered phone numbers

### Admin Controls
- ✅ Only admins (user_type == "admin") can use broadcast
- ✅ Firebase token required for all admin operations
- ✅ All broadcasts logged with admin user_id
- ✅ SMS throttling prevents spam

### Alert Safety
- ✅ Keywords validated before routing
- ✅ Duplicate alerts deduplicated
- ✅ User preferences respected (notification_channels)
- ✅ Failed sends logged for manual review

---

## ⚠️ SMS USAGE OPTIMIZATION

**Goal: Use LEAST SMS possible**

### SMS Only Sent For:
1. 🌍 **Earthquake** - Major natural disaster
2. 🌊 **Flood** - Major natural disaster
3. 💥 **Disaster** - Major natural disaster
4. ⚔️ **Attack** - Emergency situation
5. 🆘 **Emergency** - Life-threatening situation

### SMS NOT Sent For:
- ❌ Help requests (non-critical)
- ❌ Urgent (not critical)
- ❌ Alerts (informational)
- ❌ Warnings (precautionary)
- ❌ Fire (unless broadcast admin)
- ❌ Medical (unless emergency keyword)

### Admin Override
Admins can force SMS with `use_sms: true` in broadcast regardless of event type.

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test Alert Keyword Detection

```bash
python test_alert_routing.py
```

Output shows:
- ✅ 15+ keywords configured
- ✅ Critical/High/Medium severity levels
- ✅ SMS major events identified
- ✅ Workflow example

### Test with Real Community Post

1. Create a test user with location and Telegram chat ID
2. Make community post with alert keyword:
   ```
   POST /api/community/posts
   {
       "content": "HELP! Emergency at my location",
       "type": "emergency",
       "lat": 28.6139,
       "lon": 77.2090,
       "location": "Test Location",
       "author": "Test User"
   }
   ```
3. Check response includes `alert_routing` object
4. Verify Telegram message received
